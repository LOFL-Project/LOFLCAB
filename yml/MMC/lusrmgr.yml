  - Command: lusrmgr.msc /computer=W10.ad.bitsadmin.com
    Description: Local Users and Groups
    Usecases:
      - Add a backdoor user
      - Change password of existing user
      - Enable and disable accounts
      - Add users to, and remove users from groups
      - Configure backdoor logon script
    Function: Manage
    Comments:
      - Alternative is to use [compmgmt.msc](../compmgmt)
      - Through this snap-in it does not seem possible to add a user to a local group on the remote machine. Through [compmgmt.msc](../compmgmt) this _does_ work well though
